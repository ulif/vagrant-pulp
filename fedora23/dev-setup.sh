# Beware that this script references distribution-specific items such as yum.
#
# Script summary:
#
# 1. Ensure script is not running as root.
# 2. Fetch a GitHub username from the user. In most cases, the user should have a
#    GitHub account and they should supply the name of that account.
# 3. Permanently disable SELinux. The user may refuse to do this step, in which
#    case the script will abort.
# 4. Use yum to install several packages.
# 5. Enable epel yum repositories.
# 6. Make a ~/devel directory and clone several Git repositories into the current
#    directory. These repositories are cloned via SSH, and they are cloned from
#    the GitHub user named at the beginning of this script. This means that
#    whoever is running this script should have a GitHub account with SSH keys,
#    and they should have already forked the repositories into their own account.
# 7. If no ansible inventory (a list of systems) exists at
#    `/tmp/ansible_inventory`, then create an inventory pointing to localhost.
# 8. Run `ansible-playbook`. Use the inventory file at `/tmp/ansible_inventory`
#    and the playbook at `ansible/dev-playbook.yml`.
# 9. Run the final configuration script, `vagrant-setup.sh`.
