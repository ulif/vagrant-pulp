vagrant-pulp
============

Vagrant configurations for pulp envs.

Each directory in this project provides a different vagrant
configuration creating pulp developer envs.

All repositories expect a `devel` dir in `../../`, i.e. one directory
level above from this directory and two directory levels above each
vagrant dir.

`centos71`
  CentOS 7.1-based pulp env.
